[x] Adapt code to new DCPU-16 spec
	[x] Assembler
	[x] Disassembler
	[x] Emulator
	[x] Compiler

[x] Optimize parameter/local variable handling
    - always use SP instead of I/J?
      => requires to keep track of all changes to SP (e.g. push/pop operations)!

[x] Save registers inside functions that are used anywhere within the function
    (scan the emitted function code?)

[ ] Bug fixes
    [ ] Fix label handling in 3 word operations (e.g. SET [label01], 1234)
 
[ ] Conditional expressions

[ ] Additional statements
	[ ] IF
	[ ] some loop constructs
	
     
[x] Integrate original DCPU-16 emulator from 0x10c

[ ] Optimizations
    [ ] Merge multiple "ADD SP, literal" statements for nested 'let' expressions
    [ ] PH: [SP + 0] => [SP]

[ ] Macro support
    -> Macros written in Clojure syntax?
