# dcpu16-clojure

A project written as an exercise for learning Clojure, which implements ...

* an emulator 
* an assembler and disassembler
* a basic lisp compiler

... for the virtual DCPU-16 processor.

## History

The DCPU-16 used to be a virtual 16-bit processor that was designed by Markus Persson ("Notch")
for his abandoned 0x10c project.
When the development stop was announced, I stopped the development of this project as well.
